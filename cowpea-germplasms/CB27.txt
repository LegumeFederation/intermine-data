TaxonID	3920
Strain	CB27
AlternateStrainName	California Blackeye 27
Description	California Blackeye 27 (or CB27) is ideally suited to the Central Valley of California and other areas where hot weather occurs during flowering. This cultivar also produces higher blackeye bean yields in areas where races 3 and 4 of Fusarium wilt or aggressive biotypes of root-knot nematodes (like Meloidogyne incognita and M. Javanica) are present. Nematode populations in the soil are reduced following cultivation of CB27, conferring benefits to subsequent nematode susceptible crops. Therefore, CB27 is an excellent candidate for use in an annual crop rotation cycle in areas where control of root-knot nematodes is necessary.
