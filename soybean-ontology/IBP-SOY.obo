comment: Symptoms include interveinal and marginal small watery lesions with a light-green boarder. Lesions enlarge and become necrotic at the center. Also causes common blight on common bean (Phaesolus vulgaris), scarlet runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus), tepary bean (Phaseolus acutifolius), and vigna species. Severity based on natural infestations in the field, 1= Resistant with no lesions, 2=Few lesions, 3=Moderate lesions, 4=Numerous lesions, 5=Complete coverage with lesions.

comment: Resistance is associated with short internode distance prior to V6. Resistance is correlated with sclerenchyma differentiation leading to a physical barrier to the larva. Reduction of pith cavity also contributes to resistance. Vigna radiata (mung bean), V. cylindrica(cowpea) and Phaseolus vulgaris(snap bean) also attacked.

comment: Resistance is associated with short internode distance prior to V6. Resistance is correlated with sclerenchyma differentiation leading to a physical barrier to the larva. Reduction of pith cavity also contributes to resistance. Vigna radiata (mung bean), V. cylindrica(cowpea) and Phaseolus vulgaris(snap bean) also attacked.

comment: Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) is a member of the Comoviridae. Viral particles appear as 24 nm isomeric viroids. Symptoms include chlorotic mottled leaflets and other leaflet deformities. CPMV infects soybean and other legumes. This disease has also been referred to as Cowpea Yellow Mosaic Virus (CPYMV). Transmitted by the beetles Ceratoma ruficornis and Diabrotica balteata.
