Files in this directory hold QTL and trait names on a per-publication, per-mapping population(s) or genotyping study basis.
Each file specifies the publication and optional mapping population(s) or genotyping study and then lists the QTLs and traits.
If MappingPopulation has the form of parent1_x_parent2, those parent strains will be created and associated with the mapping population.
