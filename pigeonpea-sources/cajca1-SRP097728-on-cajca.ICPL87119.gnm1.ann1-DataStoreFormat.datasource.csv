	DESCRIPTION	To be able to link the genome sequence information to the phenotype, especially those related to developmental processes, a gene expression atlas of Cajanus cajan (CcGEA) have been developed. In this study,  30 samples from Asha genotype (ICPL 87119) have been used, representing different developmental stages from germination to senescence. It provides a valuable resource for pigeonpea to identify candidate genes involved in specific developmental processes and to understand the well-orchestrated growth and developmental process in this resilient crop. Platform: Illumina HiSeq 2500.

	BIOPROJ_DESCRIPTION	Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) is an important grain legume of the semi-arid tropics, mainly used for its protein rich seeds. To be able to link the genome sequence information to the phenotype, especially those related to developmental processes, a gene expression atlas of Cajanus cajan (CcGEA) have been developed. In this study, we have used 30 samples from Asha genotype (ICPL 87119), representing different developmental stages from germination to senescence. CcGEA provides a valuable resource for pigeonpea to identify candidate genes involved in specific developmental processes and to understand the well-orchestrated growth and developmental process in this resilient crop. Platform: Illumina HiSeq 2500.
