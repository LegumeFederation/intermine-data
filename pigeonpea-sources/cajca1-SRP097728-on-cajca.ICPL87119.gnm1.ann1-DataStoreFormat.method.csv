#	#Description: for LIS website	
	DESCRIPTION	TPM values calculated from HTSeq read counts mapped to exons only per gene.  
#	#Details:	
	DETAILS	Reads were mapped to reference genome using GSNAP.  HTSeq counts were generated from read alignments only to exons aggregated over a gene. TPM was calculated from these exonic read counts.
#	#Notes: For curation, private	
	NOTES	**Provide later: GSNAP parameters and ref. HTSeq count parameters and ref. Refine description and details. TPM explain and reference.
